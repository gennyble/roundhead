# roundhead
An entry for [Ludum Dare 51](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51). ~~Hopefully.~~ Surprised I did it this time. Happy, too. [Here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/roundhead) it is.

Meant to mimic a flash game I remember called Boxhead 2Play Rooms.

Uses a fork of my graphics/whatever crate smitten. [smitten/ld51](https://github.com/gennyble/smitten/tree/ld51). I have done some truly awful things to my child, my smitten. Hopefully I'll get some of those changes merged into main one day.

Expects some kind of font in the repo root. Right now it's `Cabin-Regular.ttf` but'll probably change.
